**ETL with Apache Airflow**  

🚀 A scalable and automated ETL pipeline using **Apache Airflow** for data extraction, transformation, and loading. This project orchestrates workflows efficiently, handling dependencies, retries, and scheduling with ease.  

### 🔹 **Features**  
✅ **Extract** – Pull data from databases, APIs, or cloud storage  
✅ **Transform** – Clean, aggregate, and process data using Python, SQL, or Spark  
✅ **Load** – Store processed data in a data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift)  
✅ **Orchestration** – Define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)  
✅ **Monitoring** – Track execution, logs, and alerts for failures  

### 📌 **Tech Stack**  
- Apache Airflow 🌀  
- Python 🐍  
- PostgreSQL / MySQL / BigQuery  
- Cloud Storage (AWS S3, GCS)
